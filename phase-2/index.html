            David Tune of Boambee, NSW, was reminded of a particularly clever pair of IT Diploma
            students who handed in a joint research assignment, complete with the required signed
            statement that it was all their original work.
        </section>
        <section>
            Tune recalls: "Upon reading the work for grading, I was incredibly impressed to find
            three pages of the document written in perfect technical German, particularly given
            that the students in question were none too articulate when I asked 'Sprechen sie Deutsch?'
        </section>

            End result: assignment rejected, students counselled and more care taken when cutting
            and pasting to cover assignment work.

            Anyone attending an IT lecture should expect that the lecturer knows the subject.
            But IT lecturers are a funny lot.

            Jun Li, a programmer, recalls working in IT support at a school.

            "I was told to set up a projector in one of the meeting rooms for school staff,
            as there was a presentation. Having done that, I hooked the presentation laptop
            to the network and tried to help one of the speakers from the IT faculty update
            the laptop to IE7. I logged off and asked her to log on with her account to try
            IE7.

            Neil Meyers, library assistant from Gilles Plains in SA, recalls an incident
            with a part-time computer lecturer a couple of years ago.
        </section>
        <section>
            "I work in a vocational education library, and, on night shift, library staff are
            the default computer technicians/troubleshooters. One night, this part-time
            lecturer came to the counter, stating that she'd managed to get a CD-ROM disc
            stuck in the drive. She also said she felt a bit foolish, because she was
            instructing a class in basic computing and was unable to solve the problem in
            front of a room full of students.

            Before I was able to ask out the obvious question, she piped up,
            'That's the CD drive? I thought it was the other one!', pointing to an old 5.25in
            floppy disc slot, which was there even though the drives themselves had long
            since been decommissioned.
